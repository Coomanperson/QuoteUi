### How to run

Navigate to the project folder ({RepoLocation}/quote-ui) from command prompt.  You know you're in the right place if this README.md is there.

Execute `npm start` to start the dev server

If above fails, run `npm install` to resolve any issues with packages and try again

It should automatically start in your default browser, but if not you can access it from the url: `https://localhost:3000`
